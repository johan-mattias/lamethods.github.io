  abstract  = "Processes of naturalistic reading and writing are based on
               complex linguistic input, stretch-out over time, and rely on an
               integrated performance of multiple perceptual, cognitive, and
               motor processes. Hence, naturalistic reading and writing
               performance is nonstationary and exhibits fluctuations and
               transitions. However, instead of being just complications for the
               analysis of such data, they are also informative about cognitive
               change, fluency, and reading or writing skill. To use and
               quantify such dynamics, one needs appropriate statistics that
               capture these aspects. In this article I introduce Recurrence
               Quantification Analysis (RQA) as a tool to capture such dynamic
               structure. After a conceptual introduction of the analysis, I
               present a step-by-step tutorial on how to run RQA using R.
               Guidance is given with regard to common issues and best practices
               using this time-series analysis technique. Finally, I review
               previous results from studies applying RQA to reading and writing
               and summarize current hypotheses and interpretations of RQA
               measures in the context of reading and writing.",

               their study behaviour remain limited in how they integrate
               temporality and change. To advance this area of work, the current
               study examines profiles of change in student study behaviour in a
               blended undergraduate engineering course. The study is
               conceptualised through complex dynamical systems theory and its
               applications in psychological and cognitive science research.
               Students were profiled based on the changes in their behaviour as
               observed in clickstream data. Measure of entropy in the
               recurrence of student behaviour was used to indicate the change
               of a student state, consistent with the evidence from cognitive
               sciences. Student trajectories of weekly entropy values were
               clustered to identify distinct profiles. Three patterns were
               identified: stable weekly study, steep changes in weekly study,
               and moderate changes in weekly study. The students with steep
               changes in their weekly study activity had lower exam grades and
               showed destabilisation of weekly behaviour earlier in the course.

               of change, student performance, and other approaches to learner

              of increasing complexity in a virtual learning environment
              designed to teach students about electronics. The results revealed
              that the students engaged mostly in executing, self-monitoring,

              SRL strategies are not typically used accurately leading to poor
              learning outcomes. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) attempt to
              address this issue by prompting and scaffolding learners to engage
              in SRL via using pedagogical agents. However, current literature
              does not examine the extent to which learners’ deployed strategies
              are functional or dysfunctional in relation to pedagogical agent
              scaffolding. The current study collected 117 undergraduate
              students’ data as they learned with MetaTutor, an ITS about the
              human circulatory system. Participants were randomly assigned to
              either the (1) Prompt and Feedback Condition where pedagogical
              agents scaffolded cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategies or
              (2) Control Condition where no prompts or feedback were provided.
              Results demonstrated that learners who received prompts by the
              pedagogical agents to engage in SRL had higher learning gains as
              well as greater frequencies across most strategies compared to
              those in the Control Condition who relied on self-initiated
              strategy use. While sequential transitions across all strategies
              were not significant between conditions, further analysis grounded
              in Complex Systems Theory found that learners who were prompted to
              engage in strategies demonstrated a significantly lower degree of
              repetition and balance between repetitive and novel patterns of
              strategy use. The findings suggest that pedagogical agents within
              MetaTutor successfully scaffolded the functional deployment of
              cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategies and are indicative of
              higher learning after interacting with ITSs.",

               regulation of learning (SSRL) for learners is widely acknowledged
               as a crucial element for successful collaborative learning (CL).
               However, inherent challenges are presented for the observation,
               study, and support of SSRL. Non‐verbal behaviours have been
               identified as a potentially rich resource for understanding
               learner interactions within CL. Yet, the exploration of its
               impact on SSRL remains largely unexplored.ObjectiveThe present
               study aims to explore how gaze behaviour, as a non‐verbal
               behaviour, relates to verbal interactions that characterise SSRL
               in CL.MethodsTwenty‐seven Finnish secondary school students were
               given a 30‐min group task of creating a breakfast smoothie, in
               which trigger events were integrated to examine possible
               interactions that characterise SSRL. In this experimental
               setting, data from multiple modalities were collected. For
               analysis, process mining was used to explore patterns of
               interaction, and multidimensional recurrence quantification
               analysis (MdRQA) was used, alongside with statistical
               analysis.Results and ConclusionsOur study revealed that gaze
               behaviour is intricately linked with SSRL interactions,
               suggesting a complex interplay in collaborative learning
               contexts. When temporally investigated, SSRL interactions varied
               in frequency while gaze behaviour remained constant. Moreover,
               the recurrence of gaze and SSRL interactions did not vary due to
               trigger events, confirming an established collaborative
               pattern.ImplicationsThis study advances the field by extending
               research on SSRL by introducing a ‘non‐verbal perspective’. This
               perspective enriches our understanding of collaborative learning
               environments by revealing hidden interaction patterns and guiding
               the development of more responsive and adaptive digital learning

               processes and learning performances on a writing task among
               different groups who had support from different agents, that is,
               ChatGPT (also referred to as the AI group), chat with a human
               expert, writing analytics tools, and no extra tool. A total of
               117 university students were recruited, and their multi‐channel
               learning, performance and motivation data were collected and
               analysed. The results revealed that: (1) learners who received
               different learning support showed no difference in post‐task
               intrinsic motivation; (2) there were significant differences in
               the frequency and sequences of the self‐regulated learning
               processes among groups; (3) ChatGPT group outperformed in the
               essay score improvement but their knowledge gain and transfer
               were not significantly different. Our research found that in the
               absence of differences in motivation, learners with different
               supports still exhibited different self‐regulated learning
               processes, ultimately leading to differentiated performance. What
               is particularly noteworthy is that AI technologies such as
               ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on technology and
               potentially trigger “metacognitive laziness”. In conclusion,
               understanding and leveraging the respective strengths and
               weaknesses of different agents in learning is critical in the
               field of future hybrid intelligence. Practitioner notesWhat is
               already known about this topic Hybrid intelligence, combining
               human and machine intelligence, aims to augment human
               capabilities rather than replace them, creating opportunities for
               more effective lifelong learning and collaboration. Generative
               AI, such as ChatGPT, has shown potential in enhancing learning by
               providing immediate feedback, overcoming language barriers and
               facilitating personalised educational experiences. The
               effectiveness of AI in educational contexts varies, with some
               studies highlighting its benefits in improving academic
               performance and motivation, while others note limitations in its
               ability to replace human teachers entirely. What this paper adds
               We conducted a randomised experimental study in the lab setting
               and compared learners' motivations, self‐regulated learning
               processes and learning performances among different agent groups
               (AI, human expert and checklist tools). We found that AI
               technologies such as ChatGPT may promote learners' dependence on
               technology and potentially trigger metacognitive ``laziness'',
               which can potentially hinder their ability to self‐regulate and
               engage deeply in learning. We also found that ChatGPT can
               significantly improve short‐term task performance, but it may not
               boost intrinsic motivation and knowledge gain and transfer.
               Implications for practice and/or policy When using AI in
               learning, learners should focus on deepening their understanding
               of knowledge and actively engage in metacognitive processes such
               as evaluation, monitoring, and orientation, rather than blindly
               following ChatGPT's feedback solely to complete tasks
               efficiently. When using AI in teaching, teachers should think
               about which tasks are suitable for learners to complete with the
               assistance of AI, pay attention to stimulating learners'
               intrinsic motivations, and develop scaffolding to assist learners
               in active learning. Researcher should design multi‐task and
               cross‐context studies in the future to deepen our understanding
               of how learners could ethically and effectively learn, regulate,
               collaborate and evolve with AI.",

This paper describes and provides a tutorial on one such method, categorical cross recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA), which quantifies the temporal structure and co-visitation of individual and sequential states of interest. CRQA is a useful descriptive technique that can be used to explore the extent, structures, and patterns of partner alignment within dyadic interactions.

               Nevertheless, failure to critically evaluate ideas risks
               suboptimal outcomes through so-called groupthink. Prior studies
               have shown that people who hold shared goals, perspectives, or
               understanding of the environment show similar patterns of brain
               activity, which itself can be enhanced by consensus-building
               discussions. Whether shared arousal alone can predict collective
               decision-making outcomes, however, remains unknown. To address
               this gap, we computed interpersonal heart rate synchrony, a
               peripheral index of shared arousal associated with joint
               attention, empathic accuracy, and group cohesion, in 44 groups (n
               = 204) performing a collective decision-making task. The task
               required critical examination of all available information to
               override inferior, default options and make the right choice.
               Using multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis (MdRQA)
               and machine learning, we found that heart rate synchrony
               predicted the probability of groups reaching the correct
               consensus decision with >70\% cross-validation
               accuracy-significantly higher than that predicted by the duration
               of discussions, subjective assessment of team function or
               baseline heart rates alone. We propose that heart rate synchrony
               during group discussion provides a biomarker of interpersonal
               engagement that facilitates adaptive learning and effective
               information sharing during collective decision-making.",

              where they were required to complete an ordered play-through of
              Crystal Island. As participants learned with Crystal Island,
              log-file and eye-tracking time series data were collected to
              pinpoint instances when participants interacted with instructional
              materials. Hierarchical linear growth models indicated
              relationships between eye gaze dwell time and (1) the type of
